Missing Data:
**Missing Data for January and February 1988**


Just a bit more clarification for you on the surface and horizon definitions:

SD: Surface Definition
HD: Horizon Definition


G: Good - Snow surface features such as sastrugi, drifts, and gullies are 
          easily identified by shadow.  The sun is usually unobscured.  
          The horizon is sharply defined by shadow or contrast.
F: Fair - Snow features can be identified by contrast.  No definite shadows 
          exist. The sun is usually totally obscured.  The horizon may be 
          identified although the contrast between the sky and snow is not 
          sharply defined.
P: Poor - Snow surfaces cannot be readily identified except from close up.  
          The sun is usually totally obscured.  The horizon is barely 
          discernable. Snow surfaces cannot be readily identified except from 
          close up.  The sun is usually totally obscured.  The horizon is 
          barely discernable.
N: Nil  - Snow surfaces cannot be identified.  No shadows or contrast exist.
          Dark colored objects appear to float in the air.  The sun is totally 
          obscured although the overcast may exhibit considerable glare.  The 
          glare appears to be equally bright from surface reflection and from 
          all directions.  Total loss of horizon , snow merges with the 
          whiteness of the sky.

These definitions are meant to help aviators determine landing conditions.

With regards to surface/synoptic reports of cloud layers:


The cloud groups do not necessarily represent low, middle and high cloud
layers.  They simply represent whatever cloud layers are present, beginning
with the lowest (closest to surface) layer.  Skc = no clouds; Few = 1,2
octas coverage; Sct = 3,4 octas; Bkn = 5,6,7 octas; Ovc = 8 octas.  The
numbers following represent the height of clouds above the observing surface
(not above sea-level) in feet.  Simply add 3 zeros to the numbers shown, ie.
010 = 1000ft, 025 = 2500ft, 060 = 6,000ft.  If the number is 000 then there
is a surface-based obscuration and it will be described in the Remarks
section, ie. BLSN FEW000 = Blowing snow is obscuring 1-2 octas of the sky.
